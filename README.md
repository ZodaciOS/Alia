# Alia
Upcoming open-sourced Roblox iOS executor

# Release Notes

Don't know when I will release because I am busy, but in a while.

# Features

- Full UNC & sUNC support
- Keyless, ad-free
- ScriptBlox API support

# Detection

Unless I can develop a client bypass this will most likely be detected but who cares.
This was mainly just as a simple project rather than something I want to make money from.

# Installation

**This will be useful when this releases.**

Alia supports several installation methods.

- **.deb /** For jailbroken devices. This will inject `libalia.dylib` into com.roblox.robloxmobile
- **.dylib /** For jailbroken & jailed devices. Jailbroken devices can use tweaks to manually inject into existing apps, or jailed devices can use signing apps to inject. Requires your own decrypted Roblox .ipa.
- **.ipa /** For jailbroken & jailed devices. Sideload like any other third-party application. Contains `libalia.dylib` already injected.
- **.tipa /** For devices with TrollStore.
